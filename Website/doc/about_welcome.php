<p>Thanks for downloading <a href="http://www.stainlessapp.com">Stainless</a>:  a multi-process browser for OS X.</p>

<p>Each tab in Stainless runs independently in a separate process, which means:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Increased performance.<br /><i>Slow page loads (especially due to plugins such as Flash) can't affect the responsiveness of the browser or other tabs.</i> 
</li><br /><li>Increased stability.<br /> <i>Crashed pages can't bring down the browser or other tabs.</i></li>
<br /><li>Decreased memory usage.<br /> <i>Once a tab is closed, the memory for that session is completely freed to the system.</i></li></ul></p>

	<p>Stainless started out as a technology demo to showcase my own multi-processing architecture in response to Google Chrome (Stainless 0.1 was released three weeks after Google released Chrome for Windows). Sensing an opportunity and inspired by a growing fanbase, I decided to craft Stainless into a full-fledged browser and work on features that I hadn't seen before in other browsers. </p>
	<p>A prime example is <i>parallel sessions</i>, which allow you to log into a site using different credentials in separate tabs at the same time.  This new technology is woven throughout Stainless, from the private cookie storage system, to <i>session-aware</i> bookmarks that remember the session in which they were saved.  I still believe this is a true browser innovation, and I'd love to see this implemented in Chrome.  You can check it out by selecting <i>New Single Session Tab</i> from the File menu.</p>
	<p>Please note that Stainless is no longer in development and thus will likely will never have all the features you'd find in a production-ready browser. But as I've promised to many a fan, I will be soon releasing all the source code on GitHub under the MIT license.</p>
